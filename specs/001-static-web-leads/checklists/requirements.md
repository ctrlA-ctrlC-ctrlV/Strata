## Validation Results (2025-10-20)

- All items PASS. Clarifications resolved in research and propagated to spec:
	- Pricing reveal: inline estimate + gated breakdown
	- Payments scope: quote‑only for MVP
	- Geography: initial counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare

Update: Additional acceptance criteria integrated for Homepage, Product discovery, Prefab path, Gallery overlay, Contact flow, Mobile/Accessibility, Admin dashboard, Post‑MVP 3D acceptance, and new Product Pages layout & conversion flow. Clarifications remain capped at three (pricing reveal, payments scope, geography) and are pending your decisions.

Update 2: Success Indicators and Objectives & Success Metrics incorporated. Success Criteria updated to reflect 95%+ quote completion, 100% inbox delivery (monitored), homepage click‑through, and traffic target 20K/month within 6 months.
