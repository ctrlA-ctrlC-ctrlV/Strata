## Validation Results (2025-10-16)

- Failing items:
	- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

	Specific markers and context (quoted from spec):
	- FR-011: "System MUST reveal pricing as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: indicative estimates inline vs only after form submission?]"
	- FR-012: "System MUST support purchase initiation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: include deposit/payment now or strictly collect quotes?]"
	- FR-013: "System MUST constrain serviceable geography [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Ireland nationwide vs specific counties/regions?]"

- All other checklist items currently PASS based on defined user stories, acceptance scenarios, edge cases, success criteria, and assumptions.

Update: Additional acceptance criteria integrated for Homepage, Product discovery, Prefab path, Gallery overlay, Contact flow, Mobile/Accessibility, Admin dashboard, and Post‑MVP 3D acceptance. Clarifications remain capped at three (pricing reveal, payments scope, geography) and are pending your decisions.

Update 2: Success Indicators and Objectives & Success Metrics incorporated. Success Criteria updated to reflect 95%+ quote completion, 100% inbox delivery, homepage click‑through, and traffic target 20K/month within 6 months.
