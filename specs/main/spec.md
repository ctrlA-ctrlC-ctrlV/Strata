# Feature Specification: Migrate from DigitalOcean MongoDB to Supabase

**ID**: main  
**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

## Summary

Migrate the Strata application's data persistence layer from DigitalOcean hosted MongoDB to Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time). This change will consolidate our backend services, improve type safety, provide better developer experience, and reduce operational complexity.

## Background

Currently, the Strata application uses:
- DigitalOcean hosted MongoDB for data persistence (currently empty)
- MongoDB Node.js driver for database operations
- Manual ObjectId handling and type conversions
- Custom connection management and pooling

The migration to Supabase will provide:
- PostgreSQL database with strong typing
- Built-in authentication system
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Automatic API generation
- Real-time subscriptions
- Better TypeScript integration
- Simplified deployment and operations

**Important Note**: The current MongoDB database contains no production data, so this is purely a technology replacement rather than a data migration project.

## Functional Requirements

### F1: Technology Migration
- **F1.1**: Replace MongoDB collections with PostgreSQL tables (no existing data to migrate)
- **F1.2**: Implement proper database schema and constraints
- **F1.3**: Ensure seamless technology transition without affecting API contracts
- **F1.4**: Provide clear setup and configuration procedures

### F2: Database Schema
- **F2.1**: Convert MongoDB documents to normalized PostgreSQL tables
- **F2.2**: Implement proper foreign key relationships
- **F2.3**: Add appropriate indexes for query performance
- **F2.4**: Set up Row Level Security policies

### F3: API Layer
- **F3.1**: Replace MongoDB repository classes with Supabase client
- **F3.2**: Update all database queries to use PostgreSQL syntax
- **F3.3**: Maintain existing API contracts and response formats
- **F3.4**: Implement proper error handling for PostgreSQL operations

### F4: Authentication Integration
- **F4.1**: Integrate Supabase Auth for user management (future scope)
- **F4.2**: Set up proper access control using RLS policies
- **F4.3**: Maintain existing security requirements

### F5: Development Experience
- **F5.1**: Update development environment setup
- **F5.2**: Provide migration scripts and utilities
- **F5.3**: Update documentation and developer guides
- **F5.4**: Ensure type safety with TypeScript

## Technical Requirements

### T1: Performance
- **T1.1**: Database operations must maintain current response times
- **T1.2**: Connection pooling must be properly configured
- **T1.3**: Query performance must meet or exceed current benchmarks

### T2: Reliability
- **T2.1**: Zero data loss during migration
- **T2.2**: Automatic backups and point-in-time recovery
- **T2.3**: Proper error handling and logging

### T3: Security
- **T3.1**: All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- **T3.2**: Row Level Security policies must protect sensitive data
- **T3.3**: API keys and secrets must be properly managed

### T4: Maintainability
- **T4.1**: Code must follow established TypeScript patterns
- **T4.2**: Database schema must be version controlled
- **T4.3**: Migration scripts must be idempotent and reversible

## User Stories

### US1: As a developer
- I want to work with strongly typed database operations
- So that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support

### US2: As a system administrator
- I want simplified database operations and monitoring
- So that I can reduce operational overhead and improve reliability

### US3: As a business stakeholder
- I want reduced infrastructure costs and complexity
- So that we can focus resources on feature development

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Database Setup
- PostgreSQL schema is properly created and configured
- All relationships and constraints are correctly implemented
- Data validation rules are established and functional

### AC2: API Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints return the same response format
- Query performance is maintained or improved
- Error handling provides appropriate feedback

### AC3: Development Workflow
- Local development environment uses Supabase local setup
- Migration scripts are documented and reproducible
- Test suite passes with new database implementation

### AC4: Production Deployment
- Supabase project is properly configured and linked
- Environment setup procedures are documented and tested
- Monitoring and alerting are properly configured

## Out of Scope

- User interface changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Authentication flow changes (in this phase)
- Real-time features implementation (future phase)
- Performance optimization beyond current levels

## Dependencies

- Supabase project setup and configuration
- PostgreSQL schema design and optimization
- Data migration tooling and testing
- Environment configuration updates

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Configuration Issues
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive setup documentation, testing on staging environment, validation procedures

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing, query optimization, proper indexing strategy

### Risk 3: Development Workflow Disruption
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Parallel development branches, comprehensive documentation, developer training

## Success Metrics

- Supabase successfully configured and operational
- API response times within 10% of current performance targets
- Successful deployment with proper environment linking
- Developer satisfaction scores improve with better tooling
- Reduced infrastructure costs by at least 20%
- All tests pass with new database implementation
