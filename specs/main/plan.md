# Implementation Plan: Migrate from DigitalOcean MongoDB to Supabase

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-10-22 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/main/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Replace the Strata application's data persistence layer from DigitalOcean hosted MongoDB to Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time). Since the current database is empty, this is primarily a technology migration involving replacing the MongoDB repository layer with Supabase client operations, implementing the new PostgreSQL schema, and maintaining API compatibility while improving type safety and developer experience. **No data migration is required** - focus is on proper Supabase setup and integration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 18+ (current setup)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Supabase JavaScript client v2.x + Supabase client library, PostgreSQL drivers, existing Express.js backend  
**Storage**: Migration from MongoDB 6.3.x to Supabase (PostgreSQL 15+)  
**Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support, existing test infrastructure  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (current deployment), Node.js runtime  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend structure)  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain current API response times (<200ms p95), support existing load patterns  
**Constraints**: Backward API compatibility, proper Supabase configuration and linking (no data migration needed)  
**Scale/Scope**: Current MongoDB collections (product_configurations, quote_requests), ~2-3 repository classes, existing Express API endpoints

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ Static-First: Backend migration does not impact frontend static delivery; API endpoints remain unchanged
- ✅ Performance Budgets: Backend change only; frontend performance budgets maintained
- ✅ Progressive Enhancement: No frontend changes; existing progressive enhancement preserved
- ✅ TDD: Will write failing tests for new Supabase repository implementations before migration
- ✅ Build-Time Optimization: No impact on frontend build optimization
- ✅ Security: Supabase provides HTTPS, encryption at rest/transit, RLS policies enhance security
- ✅ Quality Gates: No frontend changes; Lighthouse scores unaffected by backend migration

**Gate Status**: PASS - Backend-only migration maintains all constitutional principles

### Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation

- ✅ Static-First: API contracts preserved, no frontend impact, static delivery maintained
- ✅ Performance Budgets: PostgreSQL query optimization planned, response time targets maintained  
- ✅ Progressive Enhancement: No changes to frontend progressive enhancement
- ✅ TDD: Test strategy defined with unit/integration tests for new Supabase repositories
- ✅ Build-Time Optimization: No impact on frontend build processes
- ✅ Security: Enhanced with PostgreSQL RLS policies, Supabase managed encryption, HTTPS enforced
- ✅ Quality Gates: No frontend changes, backend API contract compatibility ensured

**Final Gate Status**: PASS - All constitutional principles maintained with security enhancements

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with backend-focused changes. The technology replacement primarily affects the `backend/src/db/` directory, replacing MongoDB-specific code with Supabase client implementations while preserving existing API contracts and frontend compatibility. Since no data migration is required, focus is on proper setup, configuration, and integration testing.

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitutional violations requiring justification.*

✅ All principles maintained during backend migration design.
