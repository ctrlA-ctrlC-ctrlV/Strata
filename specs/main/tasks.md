# Tasks: Migrate from DigitalOcean MongoDB to Supabase

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/main/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution (TDD). Write tests first; ensure they FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**URGENT**: All tasks marked for immediate execution to replace database technology.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) üö® URGENT

**Purpose**: Supabase project initialization and basic structure setup

- [X] T001 Create Supabase project on supabase.com with name "strata-garden-rooms-prod"

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites) üö® URGENT ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Core database infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Developer Database Operations (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP üö® URGENT

**Goal**: Enable developers to work with strongly typed database operations using Supabase client

**Independent Test**: Create, read, update operations work with full TypeScript intellisense and compile-time error checking

### Tests for User Story 1 (MANDATORY per constitution) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Create unit test for Supabase client connection in backend/tests/unit/db/supabase.test.ts
- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Create unit test for QuotesRepository methods in backend/tests/unit/repos/quotes.test.ts  
- [ ] T017 [P] [US1] Create integration test for complete quote workflow in backend/tests/integration/quotes-api.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Create ProductConfiguration interface matching database schema in backend/src/types/entities.ts

- [ ] T022 [US1] Update error handling in API routes to handle PostgreSQL-specific errors
- [ ] T023 [US1] Test TypeScript compilation and verify no type errors across codebase

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional with typed database operations

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - System Administrator Operations (Priority: P2) üö® URGENT

**Goal**: Provide simplified database operations and monitoring through Supabase dashboard and tooling

**Independent Test**: Database operations can be monitored, queries can be executed, and performance metrics are available

### Tests for User Story 2 (MANDATORY per constitution) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T024 [P] [US2] Create monitoring test script in backend/src/scripts/health-check.ts
- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Create database performance test in backend/tests/integration/database-performance.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 2  

- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Configure Supabase project monitoring and alerting in dashboard
- [ ] T027 [P] [US2] Create database backup verification script in backend/src/scripts/verify-backups.ts

- [ ] T030 [US2] Set up automated database health checks in production environment
- [ ] T031 [US2] Configure log aggregation and error tracking for database operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently with full admin capabilities

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Business Stakeholder Value (Priority: P3) üö® URGENT

**Goal**: Demonstrate reduced infrastructure costs and complexity through Supabase consolidation

**Independent Test**: Infrastructure costs are measurably reduced and deployment complexity is simplified

### Tests for User Story 3 (MANDATORY per constitution) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] Create deployment validation test in backend/tests/integration/deployment.test.ts  
- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] Create cost monitoring script in backend/src/scripts/cost-analysis.ts

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T035 [P] [US3] Delete MongoDB connection files: backend/src/db/mongo.ts
- [ ] T036 [US3] Update deployment configuration to remove MongoDB connection strings
- [ ] T037 [US3] Document cost savings and complexity reduction in backend/docs/migration-benefits.md  
- [ ] T038 [US3] Update deployment scripts to use only Supabase configuration
- [ ] T039 [US3] Validate production deployment with simplified infrastructure

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional with reduced operational overhead

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately üö® **START NOW**
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories üö® **URGENT**  
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3) üö® **URGENT PRIORITY ORDER**
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories üö® **MVP PRIORITY**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 üö® **ADMIN PRIORITY**
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but benefits from US1/US2 completion üö® **COST PRIORITY**

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Repository classes before API updates  
- Database operations before application logic
- Type definitions before implementations
- Core functionality before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)  
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Interface definitions within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for Supabase client connection in backend/tests/unit/db/supabase.test.ts"  
Task: "Unit test for QuotesRepository methods in backend/tests/unit/repos/quotes.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for complete quote workflow in backend/tests/integration/quotes-api.test.ts"

# Launch all interface definitions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create ProductConfiguration interface in backend/src/types/entities.ts"
Task: "Create QuoteRequest interface in backend/src/types/entities.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) üéØ **RECOMMENDED URGENT PATH**

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup üö® **Day 1**
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational üö® **Day 1-2** (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)  
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 üö® **Day 2-3**
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery üö® **FULL URGENT IMPLEMENTATION**

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready üö® **Days 1-2**
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) üö® **Days 2-3**  
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üö® **Days 3-4**
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üö® **Days 4-5**
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy (if multiple developers available)

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together üö® **Days 1-2**
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Database Operations) üö® **Priority 1**
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Admin/Monitoring) üö® **Priority 2**  
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Cleanup/Cost) üö® **Priority 3**
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
